A Quick Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is a quick example of what it looks like. I am writing this in my
notebook file by the way (using a Mardown cell).

Here is some code + output:

.. code:: 

    # have to comment out the magic IPython functions because of a bug
    #%pylab inline
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd

.. code:: 

    print np.random.randn(20)


.. parsed-literal::
   :class: pynb-result

    [-0.81256785 -1.16630768  0.27555802  0.57729188 -0.64691411  0.62288591
      0.27943851  0.10512695  0.23808598 -1.45293996 -0.24394825 -0.14631097
      1.56377514 -0.87629984  1.64059433 -0.10259616  0.84435183  0.11718899
     -0.66617413 -0.81800771]


.. code:: 

    pd.Series(np.random.randn(100)).plot()




.. parsed-literal::
   :class: pynb-result

    <matplotlib.axes.AxesSubplot at 0x7f28246381d0>

Raw NBConvert Cells
-------------------

In addition to markdown cells, you may also use **Raw NBConvert** cells. This allows you to input reST directly in your notebook. It won't look as pretty in the notebook itself, but will work great for your docs. Special reST and Sphinx markup will work within a Raw NBConvert (link, code markup, etc.).

By the way, :func:`convert_notebooks <klink.__init__.convert_notebooks>` basically calls::

    ipython nbconvert --to rst

on all the notebooks it finds. It also handles special cases and adds special css classes for display formatting purposes. If you plan on using IPython Notebook integration, you will need an up-to-date version of `pandoc <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>`_ for this to work properly.
